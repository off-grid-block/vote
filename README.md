The work started as a joint effort between the wireless and sensor networks lab at the Yale Institute for Network Science and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). A PoC was delivered in May 2020 and the Yale team continued extending the architecture and adding new features. Part of the work and initial benchmarks of the architecture deployed in off-grid settings are presented in the paper â€œA Blockchain-based Decentralized Data Sharing Infrastructure for Off-grid Networking"[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07521).
